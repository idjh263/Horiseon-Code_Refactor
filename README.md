# Code Refactor Starter Code


# Horiseon Social Solution Services, Inc

#Purpose: 
    
    I restructured the code to improve the structure and make it easier to work on, especially if additional functions and designs are added to the site. These changes were added but did not affect the functionality and external behavior of the website. 

#Built With:
    - HTML
    - CSS
